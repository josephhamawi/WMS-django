# 🎯 RESUME HERE TOMORROW

## Where You Are:
✅ Database set up (Neon PostgreSQL)
✅ Code ready on GitHub
✅ Render account created
✅ Web service created
⚠️ **BUILD FAILING** - needs one environment variable fix

---

## 🚀 ONE STEP TO FIX:

### Add Python Version Variable on Render:

1. Go to: **https://dashboard.render.com**
2. Click your **Web Service** name (warehouse-inventory)
3. Click **"Environment"** in left sidebar
4. Click **"Add Environment Variable"**
5. Add:
   - Key: `PYTHON_VERSION`
   - Value: `3.10.14`
6. Click **"Save Changes"**

**That's it!** Render will auto-deploy and should succeed.

## After It Deploys Successfully:

1. **Add 2 more environment variables:**
   - `ALLOWED_HOSTS` = `your-app-url.onrender.com`
   - `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` = `https://your-app-url.onrender.com`

2. **Create admin user** (via Render Shell):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. **Access your live app!** 🎉

## 🆘 Quick Help:

**Can't find Environment tab?**
- Make sure you click the **Web Service** (not project settings)
- Look for tabs: Dashboard, Events, Logs, **Environment**, Shell

**Local testing:**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Development/warehouse_inventory
python manage.py runserver
# Login: admin / admin123
```

**You're 95% done - just one variable to add!** 💪
