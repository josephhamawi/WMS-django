## ⚠️ CURRENT ISSUE

**Problem:** Build fails because Render is using Python 3.13.4 instead of Python 3.10.14

**Error:** `psycopg2-binary` package doesn't support Python 3.13 yet, causing:
```
ImportError: undefined symbol: _PyInterpreterState_Get
```

**Solution Needed:** Add `PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable to force Python 3.10

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (When You Continue)

### Step 1: Add Python Version Environment Variable

1. Go to Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your **Web Service** (warehouse-inventory or wms-django)
3. Click **"Environment"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"Add Environment Variable"**
5. Add:
   - **Key:** `PYTHON_VERSION`
   - **Value:** `3.10.14`
6. Click **"Save Changes"**
7. Render will automatically redeploy

**Expected Result:** Build should succeed with Python 3.10.14

---

### Step 2: After Successful Deployment

Once the build succeeds, you'll need to:

1. **Update Environment Variables** (add these in Render Environment tab):
   - `ALLOWED_HOSTS` = `your-app-name.onrender.com`
   - `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` = `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

2. **Create Admin User** (via Render Shell):
   - Go to your service → Click "Shell" tab
   - Run: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
   - Follow prompts to create admin account

3. **Access Your App:**
   - Your app URL: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`
   - Admin panel: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/admin/`

## 📋 Important Information

### Your Accounts
- **GitHub Username:** josephhamawi
- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/josephhamawi/WMS-django
- **Render Project:** https://dashboard.render.com/project/prj-d3rq878gjchc73d4bho0
- **Neon Database:** Already configured and working

### Environment Variables Needed
```
SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-render-production-key-$(date +%s)-secure
DEBUG=False
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_I9sNwLeCJBp6@ep-sparkling-wildflower-agyrgm3a-pooler.c-2.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
PYTHON_VERSION=3.10.14
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app-name.onrender.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.onrender.com
```

### Local Development
Your app works locally:
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Development/warehouse_inventory
python manage.py runserver
# Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000
# Login: admin / admin123
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Can't Find Environment Tab
- Make sure you're in the **Web Service** (not project settings)
- Look for tabs: Dashboard, Events, Logs, **Environment**, Shell, Settings

### Issue 2: Build Still Uses Python 3.13
- Clear build cache: Manual Deploy → "Clear build cache & deploy"
- Verify PYTHON_VERSION is set to `3.10.14` (not `3.10.0`)

### Issue 3: Database Connection Error
- Verify DATABASE_URL has no line breaks
- Check Neon database is active at https://console.neon.tech

## 🎬 Quick Resume Commands

When you're ready to continue tomorrow:

1. **Check Render Status:**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Click on your web service
   - Check build logs

2. **If Still Failing:**
   - Add PYTHON_VERSION=3.10.14 environment variable
   - Deploy should succeed

3. **Test Locally Anytime:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/mac/Development/warehouse_inventory
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## 💡 Why We Switched from PythonAnywhere to Render

- **PythonAnywhere free tier:** Blocks external database connections (can't use Neon PostgreSQL)
- **Render free tier:** Allows external databases, perfect for Neon
- **Trade-off:** Render sleeps after 15 min inactivity (wakes instantly when visited)

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Stuck on adding PYTHON_VERSION?**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your service name (not the project)
3. Find "Environment" tab on the left
4. Add the variable

**Build still failing?**
- Check the error logs in Render
- Verify it says "Using Python version 3.10.14"
- If still 3.13, try clearing build cache

**Want to test locally first?**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Development/warehouse_inventory
python manage.py runserver
```
